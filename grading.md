### Implementing the $1 Gesture Recognizer (4/4P)
* $1 gesture recognizer works and is efficiently implemented
    * yep (2P)
* Five gestures can be distinguished
    *  yep (1P)
* Gesture entry user interface
    * yep (1P)


### Mid-Air Gestures with $1 Recognizer (5.5/6P)
* Pose detection works reliably and with low latency
    * yep (1P)
* Mapping of landmarks to a pointer position works
    * yep (1P)
* Application controls the mouse pointer
    * yep (2P)
* Mid-air gesture interaction is integrated into $1 recognizer
    * yep (1P)
* Recording works and recorded ata is stored appropriately
    * yep (1P)
* had to continously use the keyboard while doing the gesture (-0.5P)

### Comparing Gesture Recognizers (4/5P)
* Both datasets have the same format and dimension, they are loaded correctly
    * yep (1P)
* LSTM gesture classifier works and is trained on Wobbrock et al.â€™s gesture logs
    * trained with self-recorded data instead of using wobrock (-0.5)
* Systematical comparison of different parameter counts and the $1 recognizer
    * yep (1P)
* Proper visualization and description of results
    * to compare different independent variables use one plot with two colors for example (-0.5P)
* Conclusive reasoning when comparing the LSTM vs. $1 and touchpad/mouse input vs. mid-air input
    * yep (1P)
* Correct evaluation and description with significance tests
    * statistics makes no sense
    * if you report a level of significance, but don't ever report a p-value, you should really dive deeper into statistics (pro tip: Andy Field - How to Design and Report Experiments)
    * no bonus point



### Gesture Detection Game (5/5P)
* Gesture input works with touchpad/mouse and mid-air
    * yep (1P)
* Functionality and aesthetics of the application
    * yep (2P)
    * really nice idea
* Three gestures are distinguished robustly
    * yep (2P)
